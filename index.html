            <p>Hello! I’m a computer science major with a passion for developing
               innovative solutions and showcasing my work. Check out my projects below.<br>
               I will be updating my list of projects as I have time this semester!

                <p class="project-description">Final project for Data Mining Class</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    My group was tasked with finding a dataset and performing
                    statistical analyses to find interesting patterns in the data. After conducting tests
                    we were to come up with a formalized report and share our findings in a brief presentation.
                    <br>
                    This is an updated version of my group's report so it can be more easily viewed in a web browser.
                    The majority of our work was done in Jupyter Notebooks, so I choose to utilize the
                    <a href="https://pretty-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pretty-jupyter</a> package to export a
                    user-friendly format on my portfolio. Our original pdf showing our results can be found <a href="./source/UFO/UFOResults.pdf">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    This collaborative effort required effective teamwork and clear communication to divide tasks
                    and share insights. I acted as the group leader and assigned tasks to all members in the group
                    and monitored how we were progressing. I honed my research and analytical
                    skills by performing detailed statistical tests and interpreting the results in a meaningful way.
                    We presented our findings through a formal report and presentation, demonstrating
                    strong data storytelling abilities. To make our work more accessible, I adapted our Jupyter
                    Notebook results into a user-friendly web format using the pretty-jupyter package, reflecting
                    my adaptability and attention to detail. Managing this project from analysis to presentation
                    reinforced my organizational and time management skills.

                <p class="project-description">Interactive Computer Graphics final project</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    My Interactive Computer Graphics class was done utilizing the <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library.
                    Our semester was spent learning the basics of setting up a graphics scene, how to utilize textures and material,
                    how to set up lighting in a scene, and lastly the basics of animation. We were tasked with coming up with our own final project
                    that utilizes multiple of those topics. As I am an avid Rubik's cube fan, I chose to create an interactive Rubik's
                    cube.
                    <br>
                    This project required creative thinking to design a visually engaging and functional experience.
                    It is an example of my problem-solving skills by breaking down the mechanics of a Rubik's cube into
                    more manageable pieces.Due to having a short time to work on it, but having large goals I wanted to
                    accomplish, the project strengthened my project management abilities, including
                    setting milestones and meeting deadlines. Additionally, I focused on user-centered design, ensuring
                    the project was intuitive and interactive.
                    <br>
                    Since I didn't have much time to work on the project, I had to sacrifice the animation working
                    as intended and there is still a slight issue with it. However, as I progress in my senior year I
                    intend to spend some time fixing this issue. Check back for future progress!

                <p class="project-description">Sports Analytics final project</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    My Sports analytics class was focused on analyzing, predicting, and ranking team and player performance.
                    Using publicly available datasets we made our own Simple Rating Systems, simulated NCAA tournaments,
                    and examined interesting metrics of our choice. We had creative liberty on what we wanted to do for our
                    final project, so I wanted to make my own NCAA basketball simulator. Given two teams season data (at a
                    play by play level), key metrics would be examined to come up with possession result probabilities which
                    would be used to simulate games on a possession by possession basis.
                    <br>
                    This project strengthened my analytical and critical thinking skills by identifying
                    key metrics and translating them into probabilities that drove the simulation. Extensive amounts
                    of interpreting csv files was needed which improved my data analytics skills. This project
                    also showcased my ability to work independently, manage complex tasks, and think creatively
                    to transform raw data into actionable insights.
